### :rocket: What you'll build?

_Booking service to enable barbershop's clients to schedule a visit to their barbers_. The web app is requested by one imaginary barbershop company that is dealing with a lot of potential clients leaving them as they don't have a booking service.

#### :wrench: Recommended tools

> This is an example of tools you may use to complete the project.
> You are free to use any tech stack you like as the project is tool-agnostic :slightly_smiling_face:

- React and MobX
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

Parcel already set up as a module bundler. To start the project:

```bash
npm start
```

There's a [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/) set up as a fake backend service. It automatically initialized when you start the project.

```bash
# Make sure you started the project first using `npm start`


# Get the list of barbers, each barber contains own list of services
curl localhost:1234/api/barbers/

# Get the list of all available services
fetch localhost:1234/api/barbers/
```
